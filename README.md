## Getting Started
<p>The first step is to make sure that the data base is set up appropriately and to make sure you have run through 
  <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation">laravels installation guide</a>. I set up the project using Laravel herd so i recommend doing it the same way.
</p>
<p>Once you have done that just run the commands below to install any needed dependencys and than start up the application</p>

```markdown
npm install

npm run dev
```
